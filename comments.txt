IMPORTANT COMMENTS / USAGE NOTES

1) Directory permissions (be careful):

   # Give full permissions (recursive) to a directory - USE WITH CAUTION
   chmod -R 777 <path-to-dir>

   Example:
   chmod -R 777 ./data

   SECURITY NOTE: Setting 777 makes the directory readable, writable and executable by everyone. This is insecure for production or multi-user systems. Prefer changing ownership or using more restrictive permissions such as 755, or run the service as the appropriate user:

   # safer alternatives
   chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) <path-to-dir>
   chmod -R 755 <path-to-dir>

2) Docker / Docker Compose commands

   # Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and the Docker daemon is running.

   # Start the stack (project name: data_platform) in detached mode
   docker compose -p data_platform up -d

   # Stop and remove containers started by the compose project
   docker compose -p data_platform down

   Notes:
   - Older systems use the `docker-compose` (hyphen) binary. On newer Docker (v20.10+) the recommended command is `docker compose` (no hyphen).
   - If you need to run with sudo (depending on your Docker setup):
       sudo docker compose -p data_platform up -d

3) Common troubleshooting tips

   - If you see permission errors when containers try to read/write mounted volumes, ensure the host folder ownership and permissions allow the container user to access them.
   - To inspect logs:
       docker compose -p data_platform logs -f
   - To list running containers for the project:
       docker compose -p data_platform ps

4) Quick reminders

   - Avoid using `chmod -R 777` on sensitive paths.
   - Prefer creating and using a dedicated system user or adjusting ownership for any volume-mounted data directories.
