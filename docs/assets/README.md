This folder contains visual assets used in the repository's main `README.md`.

Place screenshots, GIFs and diagrams here.

Recommended structure:

- `docs/assets/banner.svg` — hero banner or architecture overview (SVG recommended)
- `docs/assets/gifs/` — short demo GIFs (5–12s)
- `docs/assets/screenshots/` — PNG/SVG screenshots (Airflow, Jupyter, MinIO, Dremio)
- `docs/assets/diagrams/` — polished architecture diagrams (SVG)

Image suggestions:
- Screenshots: 1200px width for hero; thumbnails 400–600px
- GIFs: keep under 5MB for README embedding (short & optimized)

Add files and commit. Example usage in README:

```md
![Project banner](docs/assets/banner.svg)
![demo](docs/assets/gifs/airflow-demo.gif)
```
